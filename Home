<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Businessmen Hospital Trust was conceived in 1974. The Trust initially comprised 
of Chaudhry Nazar Mohammad, Mr. Naseem Saigol, Mr. Mumtaz A Sheikh and Syed Babar 
Ali. The idea of building a Trust Hospital for the welfare of poor and 
non-affording patients was floated by the then Chairman, Chaudhry Nazar 
Mohammad (Late). To materialize this dream, they formed a group of eminent 
businessmen who believed in social uplift, charity and philanthropic pursuits. 
These included Mr. Mohammad Husain and Shahbaz-ud-Din Chaudhry. Other issues 
including building infrastructure and hiring staff was handled by the rest of 
the Trustees.</p>
 
The location of the land at Anarkali Link Road made it possible for the hospital 
to extend healthcare facilities not only to the patients of lower income population 
of Northern Lahore but also to community living in its outskirts.</p>

The team successfully generated Rs. 5 Million for the construction and 
functioning/running expense of hospital. Hospitalâ€™s Architecture was designed 
by experienced Australian Architects who gave this hospital a unique touch by 
planning a combination of squares and rectangular style. The hospital structure 
is designed in a way that it keeps the corridors airy and bright. This proper 
but natural ventilation reduces odor.</p>

Later Mr. Ibrar A. Mumtaz, Mr. Shahid Hussain, Chaudhry Ahmad Saeed, 
Mr. Mohammad Munir Chaudhry and Mr. Altaf M. Saleem joined the Trust. Now the 
Trust comprises of seven members and is working under the leadership of Chaudhry 
Ahmad Saeed since April 1996. Their active support and cooperation has played an 
instrumental role in bringing this institute at par with international standards 
of tertiary care teaching hospital.
